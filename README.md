ChessAI
======

Small starter UCI engine and a minimal search placeholder.

Quick start
-----------

1. Install requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the engine as a UCI engine (reads stdin): python interface.py

Notes
-----

This repository contains a minimal UCI interface in `interface.py` and a basic
iterative-deepening negamax stub in `chess_ai.py`. The search is intentionally
simple and will be replaced as you provide search and evaluation specifications.
